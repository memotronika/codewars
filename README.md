# **CodeWars Problem Repository**

Welcome to my CodeWars problem repository! Here, I collect problems I want to solve and invite other developers to suggest new challenges and provide feedback to improve the repository.

## **Suggestions and Advice**

If you have interesting problems to add or suggestions for improving the repository, please add them to the `your_ideas.txt` file. You can create a new entry in the file and describe your idea or advice.

## **Restriction on Solution Additions**

To keep the repository clean and focus on problem-solving, I've decided not to allow additions of solutions from other developers. However, your assistance in selecting new problems and enhancing the repository is always appreciated!

Thank you for your participation and help in developing this repository!
